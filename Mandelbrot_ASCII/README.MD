## Mandlebrot_v1.1
First program that generates a picture output. The color scheme was not worked on and the aspect ratio of images was 1:1.

## Mandlebrot_v1.2
This version builds upon v1.1 by adding multiple color schemes. The color scheme in the picture below was created by [RogerTheRabbit](https://github.com/RogerTheRabbit). The aspect ratio of images is still limited to 1:1.

## Mandlebrot_v1.3
Aspect ratio can now by changed by setting height and width parameters to different values. The program has also been multithreaded to allow for faster execution.
